# rumi.js
A barebones framework structure for an app based on MEAN stack. This framework makes use of Node Express.js and several other Node packages to build a skeleton of a ready-to-use app. Once this repo is download, and dependencies installed, you should have an app all set with the basic structure, API, front-end, and authentication. 

## Installation
1. Make sure you have the latest npm and node installed on your machine. 
2. Install and set up MongoDB on your PC (or get a remote URL of a running MongoDB server).
3. Download this repo in a folder. 
4. Open config.js and add the URL for the MongoDB server that you have running locally or remotely.
5. Run 'npm install'.
6. Run 'node server.js'. This should have the app started and running.
7. Press CTRL + C to end the app.

## Getting started with your app.
This section requires a few parts. 1) Creating the model 2) Creating the API on top of that model 3) Creating an AngularJS based front end to hit those API and display the required info.
